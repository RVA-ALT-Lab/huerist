Writing become larger and less tidy as the play progresses. Ink is black, fading to grey. Scribe was careful and accurate in transcribing, with 71 clear errors, though whether those errors were introduced by scribe or were in the original text in unclear. Corrections were frequently made with dampening and scraping the page, the resulting gap filled with flourishes and dashes. No discernable trace of the mistakes are left.\n\nCorrections were twice made, one is possibly a new hand, the other in a definite new hand. Both used italic and paler ink.\n\nThe presence of ruled lines and their impressions on subsequent pages has led some to scholars to deem this a prompt book. According to Bentley, 'This manuscript has been creased, and two of the creases used for margins, but the creasing is not according to the system found in several professional prompt manuscripts.' It is most likely not a prompt book, as the blind rules are purely for the scribe. It is a manuscript prepared for reading."},"132":{"23677":"The Shepherds' Paradise"},"351":{"23678":"Vb 203"},"358":{"23679":"http:\/\/hamnet.folger.edu\/cgi-bin\/Pwebrecon.cgi?BBID=234867"},"384":{"23680":"5560"},"413":{"23681":{"id":"894","type":"76","title":"Date: 9 Jan 1633 \n| courtiers \n| Somerset House (London)","hhash":null},"23682":{"id":"895","type":"76","title":"Date: 2 Feb 1633 \n| courtiers \n| Somerset House (London)","hhash":null}},"414":{"23683":"5504"},"421":{"23684":"1640"},"438":{"23685":{"id":"891","type":"51","title":"The Shepherds' Paradise Poynting, Sarah 1997","hhash":null}},"481":{"23686":"29.7x19.2"},"1316":{"23687":"5590"},"1407":{"23688":"1632"},"1478":{"23689":"5602"},"1479":{"23690":"5927"},"1480":{"23691":"5608"},"1481":{"23692":"5610","23693":"5621","23694":"5611","23695":"5612"},"1482":{"23696":"66"},"1485":{"23697":"5757"},"1486":{"23698":"5640"},"1491":{"23699":"1653: borrowed by Lady Francis Persall.

This hand also added the play's title on the verso of the final leaf.\n\nOne notable feature of the stage directions is that many of the entrance directions in the right margin--particularly those that start new scenes--appear between two horizontal rules or within a box.\n\nThe manuscript suffers from extensive damage and appears to be missing 2 leaves at the beginning (comprising probably 2 or 3 scenes). The first leaf is mostly decayed and part of the text is illegible. The bottom of the final leaf (f. 19) was cut off before 1803, resulting in the loss of what was apparently Sir Henry Herbert's license (though there is no other evidence of playhouse use or the Master of the Revels' censorship in the manuscript). Damp stains appear on the bottom of every page--particularly the earlier portion of the play--and align with the damp stains on the manuscript of \"The Welsh Embassador\".\n\nThe text of the missing license was recorded by G. Chalmers in his 1799 \"Supplemental Apology\" (p. 219):\n\n\"[1624] 3 November. For the Cockpit Company; A new Play, called, The Parliament of Love: Written by Massinger.\"\n\n\"The Parliament of Love\" was entered in the Stationers' Register by Humphrey Moseley on June 29, 1660 as part of an entry of eleven plays attributed to William Rowley, but it was evidently never printed (Lea claims that the extant manuscript is the one that Moseley had, but there is no evidence of this [vi]). The play is also listed (as by William Rowley) among the list of manuscripts belonging to John Warburton and supposedly destroyed by his servant.\n\nThe manuscript of the play is bound into a single volume with the 1813 edition, F. G Waldron's 1805 manuscript contributions of speculations on the missing material which he gave to Gifford, and a letter from Edmond Malone (who thought the main hand in the manuscript was Massinger's own) to Gifford upon lending him the manuscript. During binding in the 19th century, blank leaves were interleaved between the manuscript pages."},"132":{"23505":"The Parliament of Love"},"351":{"23506":"Dyce MS 39"},"358":{"23507":"https:\/\/nal-vam.on.worldcat.org\/oclc\/1008067323"},"384":{"23508":"5555"},"413":{"23509":{"id":"873","type":"76","title":"Date: 1624 \n| Lady Elizabeth's Men \n| The Cockpit","hhash":null}},"414":{"23510":"5504"},"421":{"23511":"1624"},"422":{"23512":"1624-11-03"},"429":{"23513":{"id":"877","type":"78","title":"1624 Scribal copying without revision | Unidentified, Mixed","hhash":null},"23514":{"id":"879","type":"78","title":"1624-1642 Non-authorial revision,Scribal correcting | Unidentified, Secretary","hhash":null}},"437":{"23515":{"id":"888","type":"50","title":"Act-End Notations in Some Elizabethan Plays Turner, Robert K.","hhash":null}},"438":{"23516":{"id":"871","type":"51","title":"The Parliament of Love Lea, Katherine Marguerite 1928","hhash":null},"23517":{"id":"874","type":"51","title":"The Plays and Poems of Philip Massinger Edwards, Philip 1976","hhash":null}},"481":{"23518":"30.48 x 20"},"1314":{"23519":"5659"},"1315":{"23520":"5458"},"1316":{"23521":"5590"},"1407":{"23522":"1624"},"1478":{"23523":"5602"},"1479":{"23524":"5923"},"1480":{"23525":"5925"},"1481":{"23526":"5611"},"1482":{"23527":"19"},"1484":{"23528":"5627"},"1485":{"23529":"5633"},"1486":{"23530":"5641"},"1491":{"23531":"February 1803: loaned by Edmond Malone to William Gifford to consult for his edition of Massinger's \"Works\" and then returned to Malone\n1813: used by Gifford for the second edition of his \"Works\"\n1836: part of the library of Richard Heber sold at auction, bought by bookseller Thomas Rodd for one shilling\nLate 1830s-1869: owned by Reverend Alexander Dyce\n1869: entered the collection of the Library of the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum, National Art Library)"},"1575":{"23532":"ff. 1-19"},"1637":{"23533":"A10"},"1638":{"23534":"2144"},"1640":{"23535":"1. transcribed by a professional scribe\n2. corrections made in the same hand\n3. revised and corrected in another hand (acts 4 and 5)"},"1658":{"23536":"5668"},"1659":{"23537":"5674"},"1699":{"23538":"5678"},"1718":{"23539":"5682"},"3054":{"23540":"5759","23541":"5760"},"3055":{"23542":"5767","23543":"5766"},"3056":{"23544":"5771","23545":"5774","23546":"5772"},"3057":{"23547":"5523"},"3530":{"23548":"http:\/\/www.celm-ms.org.uk\/repositories\/victoria-and-albert-museum.html"}}},{"rec_ID":"887","rec_RecTypeID":"78","rec_Title":"1623 Scribal copying without revision,Scribal correcting,Theatrical revision | Unidentified, Mixed","rec_URL":"","rec_ScratchPad":"","rec_OwnerUGrpID":"0","rec_NonOwnerVisibility":"viewable","rec_URLLastVerified":null,"rec_URLErrorMessage":null,"rec_Added":"2019-04-02 15:28:39","rec_Modified":"2019-04-03 02:35:04","rec_AddedByUGrpID":"2","rec_Hash":null,"details":{"9":{"23301":"1623"},"353":{"23302":"1-19"},"424":{"23303":"5517","23304":"5754","23305":"5518"},"426":{"23306":"5524"},"1131":{"23307":{"id":"67","type":"72","title":"The Welsh Embassador [ Dekker, Thomas -

William Lindsay Renwick, the Malone Society editor, argues for Greene on the basis of the play's relationship to \"Friar Bacon and Friar Bungay\"; McNeir supports Renwick's argument, though Wiggins considers the relationship between the play and its prequel to be insufficient grounds for the attribution (3:138).\n\nThis play might be the \"Play of Bacon\" for which Henslowe, on 14 December 1602, advanced Thomas Downton five shillings to pay Middleton for a new prologue and epilogue for a court performance. Possibly this court performance was one of the three plays the Lord Admiral's Men performed at Whitehall on 27 December 1602, Richmond on 6 March 1603, and (possibly) 8 March 1603. The other performances listed in this record relate to a play known as \"Friar Bacon\" in Henslowe's diary; presumably, this is that play.\n\nIn the manuscript, three stage directions name John Holland in the role of Ferdinand. Holland was an actor in Strange's Men and possibly Pembroke's Men around 1590-1593.\n\nThe speech prefixes are typically one to three lines too high, suggesting that the text of the speeches on each page was copied out and then the prefixes added after.\n\nRenwick argues that the play as it appears in the manuscript is a truncated version of a longer play (vii). The sequence for the manuscript's history that Renwick proposes is that a theatrical company around 1592 desired a shortened version of the complete play; after 1598 (when Chettle apparently became active in the theater) the same or another company wished to revive the play and had Chettle fill in a gap in the copy (Renwick, xiii).\n\nThe play was bound into a single volume with \"The Wasp\", probably around 1870-1872 (Renwick, v). Folio 13 was misbound in between f. 11 and f. 12.\n\nThe manuscript is heavily damaged in places and the final leaf is torn, resulting in the loss of most of the text on it."},"132":{"11844":"Friar Bacon and John of Bordeaux"},"351":{"11845":"MS 507"},"384":{"11846":"5555"},"413":{"11847":{"id":"408","type":"76","title":"Date: 19 Feb 1592 \n| Lord Strange's Men \n| The Rose","hhash":null},"11848":{"id":"409","type":"76","title":"Date: 25 Mar 1592 \n| Lord Strange's Men \n| The Rose","hhash":null},"11849":{"id":"410","type":"76","title":"Date: 25 Apr 1592 \n| Lord Strange's Men \n| The Rose","hhash":null},"11850":{"id":"411","type":"76","title":"Date: 6 May 1592 \n| Lord Strange's Men \n| The Rose","hhash":null},"11851":{"id":"412","type":"76","title":"Date: 10 Jan 1593 \n| Lord Strange's Men \n| The Rose","hhash":null},"11852":{"id":"413","type":"76","title":"Date: 17 Jan 1593 \n| Lord Strange's Men \n| The Rose","hhash":null},"11853":{"id":"414","type":"76","title":"Date: 30 Jan 1593 \n| Lord Strange's Men \n| The Rose","hhash":null}},"414":{"11854":"5504","11855":"5506"},"421":{"11856":"1590-1599"},"429":{"11857":{"id":"439","type":"78","title":"Scribal copying without revision | Unidentified, Secretary","hhash":null},"11858":{"id":"440","type":"78","title":"Theatrical revision | Unidentified, Secretary","hhash":null},"11859":{"id":"441","type":"78","title":"Theatrical revision | Unidentified, Italic","hhash":null},"11860":{"id":"442","type":"78","title":"Authorial revision (subsequent) | Chettle, Henry, Secretary","hhash":null},"11861":{"id":"443","type":"78","title":"Authorial revision (subsequent) | Unidentified, Secretary","hhash":null}},"437":{"11862":{"id":"415","type":"55","title":"Robert Greene and \"John of Bordeaux\".

However, a \"Marriage of Wit and Wisdom\" appears as one of the plays performed by the players in Anthony Munday's \"Sir Thomas More\" (ca. 1590) and a printed edition is listed in Rogers and Ley's 1656 \"exact and perfect catalogue of all Places that are Printed\" (Lennam, ix).\n\nMerbury was a student at Christ's College, Cambridge, from 1571 to 1578; Lennam suggests that he wrote the play earlier in his career there (Lennam, xi; see also Wiggins, 2:129)."},"132":{"6210":"The Marriage Between Wit and Wisdom"},"351":{"6211":"Additional MS 26782"},"358":{"6212":"http:\/\/searcharchives.bl.uk\/IAMS_VU2:IAMS032-002030556"},"384":{"6213":"5565"},"414":{"6214":"5504"},"421":{"6215":"1579"},"429":{"6216":{"id":"223","type":"78","title":"1579 Scribal copying without revision | Unidentified, Mixed","hhash":null},"6217":{"id":"224","type":"78","title":"1579 Scribal copying without revision | Unidentified, Mixed","hhash":null}},"438":{"6218":{"id":"225","type":"51","title":"Five Anonymous Plays Farmer, John Stephen 1908","hhash":null},"6219":{"id":"229","type":"51","title":"A Contract of Marriage between Wit and Wisdom Farmer, John Stephen 1909","hhash":null},"6220":{"id":"232","type":"51","title":"The Marriage Between Wit and Wisdom Lennam, Trevor N.

The author might have been Laurence Johnson (the scribal corrector who signed and dated the title page, \"Kettering die 20 Novembers Anno 1577) or Anthony Rudd (whose name appears on f. 1r).

Johnson then made corrections. Then Richards added Rudd's name on the title-page to give him credit as author.

Expenses associated with the performance, including the making of the manuscripts, are given in Westminster Abbey Muniment 54000 (reproduced in Payne). The school paid 12d \"for paper otherwise bestowed on wryting owe the childrenes partes\", but these are no longer extant. In addition to the Queen's copy, four other copies were made, also bound in vellum with silk ribbon strings, but these are no longer extant. Two of these were written out -- \"thone in text, thither in romaine hande\" -- by \"Mr Allen his sonne\", who was paid 6s, 8d.

Treatises by Thomas Milles, Gerard Malynes, Edward Misselden, and Thomas Mun are considered alongside plays by William Shakespeare, Thomas Middleton, Walter Mountfort, Thomas Heywood, Ben Jonson, Philip Massinger, and Richard Brome. Adapting approaches pioneered by scholars of Science Studies and the Rhetoric of Economics, Bradley Ryner compares the formal features of mercantile treatises and plays. He argues that Renaissance playwrights crafted absorbingly self-reflexive models of economic exchange by making productive use of the imperfection of their metaphors, the representational instability of their props and characters, the necessarily limited vantage points of their audiences, and the interpretive energies and generic expectations of these audiences. He shows how these techniques facilitated thinking through questions that were pertinent to seventeenth-century audiences, such as how to conceptualise royal finanace, currency exchange, global trade, and poverty as part of a systemic totality -- an \u2018economy\u2019 in the modern sense."},"321":{"83":"9780748684656"}}},{"rec_ID":"26","rec_RecTypeID":"10","rec_Title":"Ryner, Bradley","rec_URL":"","rec_ScratchPad":"","rec_OwnerUGrpID":"2","rec_NonOwnerVisibility":"viewable","rec_URLLastVerified":null,"rec_URLErrorMessage":null,"rec_Added":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","rec_Modified":"2017-10-10 04:27:10","rec_AddedByUGrpID":"2","rec_Hash":null,"details":{"1":{"75":"Ryner"},"18":{"76":"Bradley"}}},{"rec_ID":"23","rec_RecTypeID":"51","rec_Title":"Separation Scenes: Domestic Drama in Early Modern England Christensen, Ann 2017","rec_URL":"","rec_ScratchPad":"","rec_OwnerUGrpID":"2","rec_NonOwnerVisibility":"viewable","rec_URLLastVerified":null,"rec_URLErrorMessage":null,"rec_Added":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","rec_Modified":"2017-10-10 04:25:43","rec_AddedByUGrpID":"2","rec_Hash":null,"details":{"1":{"68":"Separation Scenes: Domestic Drama in Early Modern England"},"9":{"69":"2017"},"15":{"70":{"id":"24","type":"10","title":"Christensen, Ann","hhash":null}},"138":{"71":"10.2307\/j.ctt1hxgb28"},"312":{"72":"318"},"320":{"73":"This analysis of five exemplary domestic plays\u2014the anonymous Arden of Faversham and A Warning for Fair Women (1590s), Thomas Heywood\u2019s A Woman Killed with Kindness (1607), Thomas Middleton\u2019s Women Beware Women (ca. 1613), and Walter Mountfort\u2019s The Launching of the Mary, or The Seaman\u2019s Honest Wife (1632)\u2014offers a new approach to the emerging ideology of the private and public, or what Ann C. Christensen terms \u201cthe tragedy of the separate spheres.\u201d Feminist scholarship has identified the fruitful gaps between theories and practices of household government in early modern Europe, while work on the global Renaissance attends to commercial expansion, cross-cultural encounters, and colonial settlements. Separation Scenes brings these critical concerns together to expose the intimate and disruptive relationships between the domestic culture and business culture of early modern England.\n \nSeparation Scenes argues that domestic plays make the absence of husbands for business the subject of tragedy by focusing not on where men traveled but on whom and what they left behind. Elements that critics have rightly associated with domestic tragedy\u2014adultery, sensational murders, and the lavishly articulated operations of domestic life\u2014define this world, which, Christensen argues, was equally shaped by the absence of husbands. Her interpretations of these domestic plays invite us to historicize and further complicate the seemingly universal binary between a feminine \u201cprivate sphere\u201d and a masculine \u201cpublic sphere.\u201d\n \nSeparation Scenes demonstrates how domestic drama played an active, dynamic, and critical role in deliberating the costs of commercial travel as it disrupted domestic conduct and prompted realignments within the home."},"321":{"74":"9780803290655"}}},{"rec_ID":"24","rec_RecTypeID":"10","rec_Title":"Christensen, Ann","rec_URL":"","rec_ScratchPad":"","rec_OwnerUGrpID":"2","rec_NonOwnerVisibility":"viewable","rec_URLLastVerified":null,"rec_URLErrorMessage":null,"rec_Added":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","rec_Modified":"2017-10-10 04:20:52","rec_AddedByUGrpID":"2","rec_Hash":null,"details":{"1":{"66":"Christensen"},"18":{"67":"Ann"}}},{"rec_ID":"19","rec_RecTypeID":"80","rec_Title":"Epilogue","rec_URL":"","rec_ScratchPad":"","rec_OwnerUGrpID":"2","rec_NonOwnerVisibility":"viewable","rec_URLLastVerified":null,"rec_URLErrorMessage":null,"rec_Added":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","rec_Modified":"2017-10-10 00:34:09","rec_AddedByUGrpID":"2","rec_Hash":null,"details":{"432":{"45":"5546"}}},{"rec_ID":"18","rec_RecTypeID":"80","rec_Title":"Prologue","rec_URL":"","rec_ScratchPad":"","rec_OwnerUGrpID":"2","rec_NonOwnerVisibility":"viewable","rec_URLLastVerified":null,"rec_URLErrorMessage":null,"rec_Added":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","rec_Modified":"2017-10-10 00:33:57","rec_AddedByUGrpID":"2","rec_Hash":null,"details":{"432":{"44":"5545"}}},{"rec_ID":"17","rec_RecTypeID":"80","rec_Title":"Character list","rec_URL":"","rec_ScratchPad":"","rec_OwnerUGrpID":"2","rec_NonOwnerVisibility":"viewable","rec_URLLastVerified":null,"rec_URLErrorMessage":null,"rec_Added":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","rec_Modified":"2017-10-10 00:33:41","rec_AddedByUGrpID":"2","rec_Hash":null,"details":{"432":{"43":"5543"}}},{"rec_ID":"16","rec_RecTypeID":"73","rec_Title":"33 folios","rec_URL":"","rec_ScratchPad":"","rec_OwnerUGrpID":"2","rec_NonOwnerVisibility":"viewable","rec_URLLastVerified":null,"rec_URLErrorMessage":null,"rec_Added":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","rec_Modified":"2017-10-10 00:21:17","rec_AddedByUGrpID":"2","rec_Hash":null,"details":{"352":{"18":"33"}}},{"rec_ID":"15","rec_RecTypeID":"4","rec_Title":"BL : British Library","rec_URL":"https:\/\/www.bl.uk","rec_ScratchPad":"","rec_OwnerUGrpID":"2","rec_NonOwnerVisibility":"viewable","rec_URLLastVerified":null,"rec_URLErrorMessage":null,"rec_Added":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","rec_Modified":"2017-10-10 00:18:52","rec_AddedByUGrpID":"2","rec_Hash":null,"details":{"1":{"14":"British Library"},"2":{"15":"BL"},"22":{"16":"5423"},"26":{"17":"118"}}},{"rec_ID":"14","rec_RecTypeID":"75","rec_Title":"Comedy","rec_URL":"","rec_ScratchPad":"","rec_OwnerUGrpID":"2","rec_NonOwnerVisibility":"viewable","rec_URLLastVerified":null,"rec_URLErrorMessage":null,"rec_Added":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","rec_Modified":"2017-10-09 22:31:25","rec_AddedByUGrpID":"2","rec_Hash":null,"details":{"381":{"12":"5456"},"382":{"13":"5458"}}},{"rec_ID":"13","rec_RecTypeID":"10","rec_Title":"Mountfort, Walter","rec_URL":"","rec_ScratchPad":"","rec_OwnerUGrpID":"2","rec_NonOwnerVisibility":"viewable","rec_URLLastVerified":null,"rec_URLErrorMessage":null,"rec_Added":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","rec_Modified":"2017-10-09 22:18:07","rec_AddedByUGrpID":"2","rec_Hash":null,"details":{"1":{"8":"Mountfort"},"3":{"9":"Clerk, East India Company.
